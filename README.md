# Advent of Code Solutions
Welcome to my repository where I share my solutions for the Advent of Code. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming challenges that can be solved in any programming language you prefer.

## About Advent of Code
Advent of Code is created by Eric Wastl and involves a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. More information about the event can be found on the official website: [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

## My Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to the challenges. I've attempted to solve them in Python. I hope my solutions can provide you with a different perspective or help you learn something new.
